#In order to automate the above execution, you can use the scripts/run.sh.

#======= If you need to change the transfer method ======
#To test a different method of transfer you need to edit the source.cpp file to change the type 
#of the sender. (the current one is of type WritetoSender). If you select an MSG type of sender
#you have to edit the sink.cpp file as well
